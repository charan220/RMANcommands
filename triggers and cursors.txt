Exlicit cursors : cursors which are written by the user . cursors are mainly used to get a single row from the table and process the data and continues.....


Example :

declare           //declare a cursor and assign sql statement to cursor.
cursor c1 is select course_name,price from courses;
cname courses.course_name%type;            // assign record value to variables
cprice courses.price%type;
begin
open c1;     //opening a cursor 
loop
fetch c1 into cname,cprice;      // fetching records 
exit when c1%NOTFOUND;           //checking the record if not found
dbms_output.put_line(cname||' '|| cprice);
end loop;
close c1;
END;



Implicit cursors : implicit cursors are the cursors which are generated by the oracle server and whch are mainly used to know whether the DML like insert del update are processed or not .


Example:

declare 
v_course_id courses.course_id%type
begin
vcourse_id:=&course_id
Delete from courses WHERE course_id=vcourse_id;
IF SQL%FOUND
dbms_output.put_line(record deleted);
else
dbms_output.put_line("no such record found");
end if;
commit;
end;




TRiggers: triggers are executed implicitl by oracle. it is course of action to be taken when any DML or DDl event occurs.
triggers are executed automatically when user performs DML operation on table.

Why we create Triggers:
1) To control DML 
Table level triggers(DML triggers),
Database level triggers(DDl triggers)

Statement Level triggers : works on table level
 limited to table scope
executed only once for each statement. 

Rowlevel trigger: executed once for each row affected by the DML.

create or replace trigger trg1 before update on courses
begin
dbms_output.put_line('record updated');
end;
